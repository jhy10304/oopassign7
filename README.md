<h1>falling floor</h1>
<p>This is a game name Falling Floor.</p>
<p>You are a blue cube, and you like to move continuously.</p>
<p>You are in a square which is dangerous to you.</p>
<p>If you change your direction, a piece of tile will fall.</p>
<p>Beneath the square is a water pool, and sadly you can't swim.</p>
<b>So if you fall in to it, you die:D</b>
